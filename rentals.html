         <p id="about_text">There are days when traveling can seem like a chore - there are clothes to pack, lodging arrangements to be made, but what about your medical supplies?  The costs associated with traveling is expensive and it isn't always cost effective to bring your necessary medical items with you.  Affordable Medical can supply all of your needs, no matter where you are traveling to in Florida.<br><br> 

We often receive calls from concerned family members and travelers who are concerned about having their medical needs met while visiting Florida.  Our rental service and Concierge Program has just what you need, when you need it.  Our caring staff delivers walkers, wheelchairs, respirators, oxygen tanks, and other medical equipment to your cruise ship, to your second home, to wherever you are.  We are very careful to make sure your wheelchair and walker are fitted to you.  Our delivery team will make sure your rental equipment fits your specficiations and they will go over its usage for proper use and safety.  It is with care and concern that we want to make sure you are comfortable.  Call us today so we can have your rental equipment ready when you get here.</p>

	If you have a family member who is traveling, or in need of medical equipment but does not immediately qualify through your specific insurance, you can get equipment quickly by privately renting from Affordable Medical Supply. </br></br>

<p id="about_text" style="text-align: center; color:#d9b31c; font-weight: bold;">Delivery, set up and equipment education are all part of our standard care. </br></br></p>
<p id = "about_text">
If you cannot get a verification of benefits from your insurance company in time for your need, you can privately rent it from us until you get everything certified. We provide rental equipment to facilities that need additional equipment to provide care, but do not want to buy it permanently. Our facility coordinator can provide a rental program for the rentals of specialized equipment such as low air loss mattresses, patient lifts and rehab equipment. We deliver, set up and maintain them all on an as needed basis.  </br></br>

Let us know if you are a snowbird and only here for a few months…we have the most fair and honest rates available in town. </br></br>
