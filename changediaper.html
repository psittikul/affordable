	    <p class = "categorytextbody">
	      The most important challenge of maintaining adult diapers is managing to keep your patient's skin clean and healthy. Well timed changes, careful cleansing with adult wipes and the use of appropriate powder or moisturizing lotions are essential to the patient's comfort and help avoid rashes or infections.<br><br>

	      It is also important that you have a properly sized adult diaper for your patient. A good fit contributes a great deal to the ease of use, once again keeping skin in good shape and extra laundry requirements to minimum. As with most things in life, there may be some trial and error involved, but a good starting point is to buy the smallest size that you think will fit your patient comfortably.<br><br>

	      To keep the task simplified every time, stock a basket or bedside drawers with the necessary supplies:</p>
	    <div class="wrapper_links">
	      <ul class="linkslist">
		<li>Adult diapers</li> 
		<li>Latex gloves</li>
		<li>Wipes</li> 
		<li>Trash bags for soiled material</li> 
		<li>Bed pads</li>
		<li>Powder and lotion</li>
	      </ul>
	    </div>
	    <p class="categorytextbody">
	      Once you have run through this checklist and donned the gloves, you are ready for the actual mechanics which might involve a little "rock and roll" when your patient is bed bound.<br><br>

	      First, undo the diaper tabs. At this point, it is generally easier to continue the change by having your patient lie on their side facing away from you. This is the "rock and roll" bit. If they need assistance rolling into this position, guide their movement always from the hips, never by their shoulders, arms or legs. Next, gently guide their knees up toward their chest. This simple move makes clean up a lot easier.
	      <br><br>

	      Now start rolling the soiled surface of the diaper inward as you pull the material back from the patient's skin, keeping any mess tucked inside. Toss the diaper into the ready trash bag.
	      <br><br>
	      Thoroughly cleanse and dry the exposed skin, wiping from front to back and paying careful attention to nooks and crannies. Use powder or lotion as necessary. Repeat the rollover procedure to the patient's opposite side to complete cleansing. While your patient is still on their side, change out the bed pad for a fresh one if needed. In order to make sure the clean pad will be centered under the patient when you are all done, keep one third of the pad rolled up against their body so it is easy to pull into position once the patient is situated on their back again.
	      <br><br>
	      With the clean bed pad in place and the patient still on their side, you can now carefully unfold and position the clean diaper you will be rolling the patient back on to. When the patient is returned to their back onto the fresh diaper, continue to cleanse and care for any earlier missed areas before taping the diaper shut. Remember to keep the adult diaper and bed pad as wrinkle free as possible, because wrinkles contribute to chafing and bedsores.
	      <br><br>
	      After dealing with any soiled laundry and trash, throw away your gloves and thoroughly wash your hands. Now you are a qualified pro.
